 elven.0100.t:0 "The Lady of Lorien"
 elven.0100.desc:0 "Once, Galadriel left the Blessed Realm, proud and desiring of a realm of her own. The daughter of Finarfin, son of Finwë, she is said to be among the greatest of the [noldorelves|E], perhaps being second only to [feanor|E] himself. \n\nWhen offered pardon at the end of the [firstage|E], she refused, declaring she had done nothing requiring pardon. She has dwelled in many lands in pursuit of her dream of lordship, and at last, she now has it. In [lothlorien|E], Galadriel has wrought a realm which is her own, fair and beautiful in equal measure, strong and safe.\n\nBut there is a world beyond Lothlorien, and Galadriel knows this well. Long has she battled [sauroncharacter|E] in her mind, and her aid given where it might aid those beyond her borders. Now, with the end of the age drawing near, wise Galadriel sees only two endings for her realm, and herself. Either the bitter victory, or the long defeat at last. Time shall tell."
 #elven.0100.a:0 "On the one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope."
 elven.0100.a:0 "The Shadow stirs in Dol Guldur. We must act, lest it consumes us."
 elven.0100.att:0 "Once, the realm of Lorien extended to the eves of Fangorn and the Limlight. Men now dwell in the fields of Celebrant, imperiled by the Shadow. Perhaps the time has come to take them under the protection of the Galadhrim and reassert the ancient boundaries of Lorien.\n\n#P You send an envoy to the Men of Parth Celebrant, a superstitious but honorable folk, and offer them protection as your vassals.#!"
 elven.0100.b:0 "We must see to our own realm."
 elven.0100.btt:0 "#N You chose to leave the Men outside your realm to their fate to focus on preparing for the great clash with Dol Guldur.#!"
 
 elven.0150.t:0 "An Envoy of the Fae"
 elven.0150.desc:0 "This morning, a stranger arrived in my home. They introduced themselves as a messenger of the Radiant Lady, an emissary of the Fey Court! They talk of the rising shadow in Dol Guldur and offer us protection and guidance in our struggle against this threat. However, many of my clan are suspicious of this messenger - were they truly sent by [foldewyncharacter|E]?\n\nIf we become subjects of the Fae, we could reignite my clans' ancient claim to Drownholt! It falls upon me to decide the fate of my people."
 elven.0150.a:0 "We shall thank the Radiant Lady for her protection."
 elven.0150.att:0 "You will travel to [dwimordene|E] and thank her for her protection."
 elven.0150.b:0 "We are a hardy people, we can endure the shadow on our own."

 elven.0153.t:0 "Men of Celebrant pledge their Allegiance."
 elven.0153.desc:0 "Today, a [parthruler.GetWomanMan] arrived at my court. [parthruler.GetSheHe] introduced [parthruler.GetHerselfHimself] as [parthruler.GetFullName], Clanleader of the [northmen|E] of Parth Celebrant. \n\n"I came to [dwimordene|E] to personally express my gratitude for your protection against the Shadow. Dark words have we heard from Drownholt as of late, of terrible deeds and sacrifice done in the name of their new god." \n\nFurthermore, [parthruler.GetSheHe] explained that a few generations ago, [parthruler.GetHerHis] people still dwelled in Drownholt, until the clans split after a succession dispute and they were forced to cross the Anduin.\n\nAs word spreads that I, the Radiant Lady, have become their patron, the Guthmunding Clan's claim has strengthened again and they wish to reclaim their ancient homestead that has fallen to the Shadow. Despite being few in number, their people have found new hope and are eager to fight."
 elven.0153.a:0 "Together, we can drive back the Darkness."
 
 elven.0101.t:0 "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0101.desc:0 "When my dear friend [mithrandircharacter|E] gave me the Elessar, he prophesied that I would be but a caretaker for it, and that it would eventually pass to one who would take the name Elfstone.\n\nI foresaw this day in my mirror, when my grand-daughter would fulfill her destiny and marry Aragorn.\n\nIt is a bittersweet day for me: Arwen is visibly happy, her beauty more radiant than ever, a living image of Luthien of old. But by this marriage she chooses the Gift of Men, and will be forever sundered from me."
 elven.0101.a:0 "As was foretold, the Elfstone will go to Elessar"
 elven.0101.b:0 "I cannot bring myself to part with it."
 
 elven.0102.t:0 "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0102.desc:0 "Lady Galadriel rode in with Arwen for the wedding celebration in [minastirith|E]. When her turn comes to congratulate us she gives me the Elfstone, the green Elessar of prophecy. With it I will heal my suffering people."
 elven.0102.a:0 "This is a royal gift!"
 
 elven.0200.t:0 "The Elvenking"
 elven.0200.desc:0 "Born in fallen Doriath in [beleriand|E] of old, Thranduil is an elf whose moods change as the seasons. He can be jovial and kind one moment, and appear stubborn and withdrawn the next. It is a temperament that suits his realm's position. Yet none can doubt the skill or the hard-won wisdom of the Elvenking. \n\nRising to the throne after the loss of his father Oropher in the [lastallianceshort|E], the Woodland Realm has withdrawn into a stable but secluded position in the northeast of the [greenwoodshort|E]. Here Thranduil built Aradhrynd, the Halls of the Elvenking, made in the memory of Menegroth of old. But Thranduil did not have the riches of Thingol, nor the aid of the [dwarves|E] in its delving, and so it is smaller - a settlement or stronghold, not a city. Even so, those who visit his subterranean halls speak of finely carved stone wrought in the shape of trees, with great well-lit caverns, shafts bringing air and light.\n\nThranduil is a solitary lord - he concerns himself rarely with the affairs of those outside of his realm, foreboding the evil that dwells beyond it. His borders are harassed by [orcs|E], spiders, and even fallen [conceptracemen|E], defiling the ancient forest which once his people alone had ruled. The vigilance of Thranduil and his people is the shield which protects them. But Thranduil has long known that a day will come when the Shadow will fall once more upon all the forest, and when that day comes, he shall fight."
 elven.0200.a:0 "The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure."
 
 elven.0300.t:0 "The Lord of Imladris"
 elven.0300.desc:0 "Master [elrondshort|E]. A simple title for an Elda of such high lineage. Born as one of the twin children of Ëarendil and Elwing, Elrond had in him united the royal lines of the [sindarelves|E] and the [noldorelves|E] and the chiefs of [conceptracemen|E]. But for himself he took but the title of 'Master', a loyal councilor and regent to his kin Gil-galad, though King or High-king alike were his to claim.\n\nIn the dwindling days of the [thirdage|E], Elrond has taken over leadership of the Noldor still remaining in [middleearth|E], guiding them from the hidden vale of [imladris|E]. In it he has made a refuge of learning and healing, a homely house where lore and knowledge of yore have been preserved.\n\nYet Elrond knows that the peace of Imladris is an island in a sea of chaos, and for him, all endings of the Third Age are now wrought with peril. If the darkness should finally be ended and all the sorrows of the Elves avenged, then Imladris shall fade, and he depart into the west. If the Darkness should triumph, Imladris may stand alone as a beacon of light ere all others fail.\n\nFor now, he will do what he has always done - give what aid and advice he might, and if neccessary, fight..."
 elven.0300.a:0 "A power slumbers here that may yet endure where all others fail."
 
 elven.0400.t:0 "The Master of the Havens"
 elven.0400.desc:0 "Long has Cirdan waited, and longer yet will he wait. The Lord of the [greyhavens|E] is one of the oldest [elves|E] remaining in [middleearth|E], for long ago he was charged by [ulmocharacter|E] to build ships to ferry Elves to [valinor|E]. Thus he has done, faithfully fulfilling his duty, serving as tutor and councilor to many who have passed through his havens.\n\nThough [lindon|E] is no longer what it once was, Cirdan rules one of the largest and strongest of the Elven realms left in Middle-earth, even in these waning days. Though he is far-off and removed from the threat to the East, Cirdan will ever do his duty, to the [valargods|E] and to the Free People."
 elven.0400.a:0 "My heart is with the Sea, and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails."

 elven.0500.t:0 "The Fate of Sîrgala"
 elven.0500.desc:0 "Once, the kingship of Sîrgala stretched far, to Baranduin in the west and as far north as Lake Nenuial. Though not well-peopled, the semi-migratory [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] knew peace and propserity, particularly after King Bornmîr swore fealty to High-king Gil-galad. But the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E] brought great devastation to the lands of the Sîrrandrai, for they were a people who knew little of war. In its wake, many of the survivors fled into Lindon or indeed oversea to [valinor|E], with only a hardy few returning to their ancient lands. Thereafter, much of the lands of the Sîrrandrai were settled by [faithful|El] [dunedain|E] settlers, who acknowledged the authority of the Lord of the Sîrrandrai, but now, the world is changing. \n\nWith the [downfallofnumenor|E] and the establishment of Elendil's kingdom of [arnor|E], many now say the time has come for the Sîrrandrai to place the future of their lands in the hands of their mannish vassals and friends. The [dunedain|E] who owe theoretical fealty to Sîrgala yearn to join him, and Elendil is a honorable soul. Now, Merethorn and Eliniel take counsel to decide the fate of their realm..."
 elven.0500.a:0 "We shall place our trust in Elendil."
 elven.0500.a.tt:0 "You will relinquish the lands of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier], integrating it into [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier]. In exchange, you will become the Warden of [GetTitleByKey('d_emyn_beraid').GetNameNoTier]."
 elven.0500.b:0 "Sîrgala wanes, but is not yet gone!"
 elven.0500.b.tt:0 "We shall not cede our claim to Elendil and the Dunedain. This may have consequences, as the Dunedain settlers in our land desire to join with the High-king..."

  elven.1000.t:0 "The Last Son of Fëanor" # Title for Maglor intro
  elven.1000.desc:0 "Once, there were seven. Now, I am the last. In folly of youth, despair, love, and rage was an [Concept('oathoffeanor','oath')|E] sworn which drove us to our ruin. To ill end indeed did come all we began well. I will not say no good was done, for good was done. Yet good does not erase evil, even if good comes of it.\n\nFor three-thousand years, I wandered the seashore, lamenting. I can scarcely remember those days, the black pit of despair a maw which consumed everything. I did not know of the death of my nephew, not until it was far too late. Yet my deeds and my oath set me still apart from my people, and so I came here, to Himring. Here have I dwelled since. Despite my best efforts, news of my presence became known, and some of my most foolishly loyal followers came and joined me.\n\nWe have built a life, after a fashion. Humble, yet peaceful. Yet even we hear the words carried on the wind and in the seas. The [Concept('sauroncharacter','Darkness')|E] rises anew, and the strength of the Free Peoples is not what once it was. Dare I act?"

  elven.1500.desc:0 "I can remain secluded no more. Yet I am, as now, but one [Concept('eldar','Elda')|E], with a small following. To fight [sauroncharacter|E], I shall need to plan carefully. Two paths lie before me. Try to rally what Elves I can and take the fight to Sauron directly? Or assert my claim (though questionable) to the position of High-king, before leveraging that power to defeat Sauron?"
  elven.1500.a:0 "We shall take the fight to Sauron." # Crusade Against Darkness
  elven.1500.a.tt:0 "Maglor will rally what Elves he can to his banner, before taking the war to Sauron.\n\nUnlock the #V Rally the Army of the Righteous#! [decision|E], which will determine the route you take."
  elven.1500.b:0 "I shall unite the Elves once more under the High-kings." # Kingship by Seniority
  elven.1500.b.tt:0 "Maglor will attempt to claim the High-kingship of the Noldor on account of his status as the most senior male Finweion left in Middle-earth.\n\n#N This choice will almost assuredly result in war with Lindon, as few will accept the claim of a Fëanorian.#!"

  elven.1601.desc:0 "There are many threats which have slowly choked the Free Peoples. The [dwarves|E] have lost their great realms of old, the [elves|E] are diminished and split apart from each other. To defeat [sauroncharacter|E], we must be united. To unite, these threats must be quelled. \n\nSuch was my decision. The first step is to cleanse the Misty Mountains and restore the Dwarves, our allies of ancient days. There is an obvious place for us to begin this work, then - Eregion, the realm of my nephew [celebrimbor|E]. The ancient ruins of the kingdom have decayed but with work can be rebuilt. The close proximity to [khazaddum|E] makes it an ideal location from which to begin the work of cleansing it. \n\nSo we set out, leaving behind Himring and Lindon, marching forth for what may be the final war of the High-Elves."

  elven.1602.desc:0 "There can be no delay. Every day, every month waited, Sauron grows in strength, while our own wanes. We must strike him soon, or lose the ability entirely.\n\nSuch was my decision. The ancient haven of Edhellond sits abandoned in Gondor, with few Men daring to touch its silent halls. It is a safe location, but close to Sauron and his dominions. We shall rebuild it and use it as the mustering place of our strength."

Comparatively, the Elves are fewer, but none can doubt their skill and valor. While once disorganized, my leadership skills have proven themselves not so rusted as I thought. Now both sides work together ably, though perhaps still not to the level of the great Mannish-Elven armies of Beleriand of old. Our fleet is somewhat motley, with graceful oarless Elven-craft berthed alongside lumbering Gondorian ships. Yet I have faith. A new note is in the air, a new chorus to the song, one perhaps not originally intended but adding a unique harmony to it.\n\nPenance begins here, by fire and sword and hate of evil which will not rest ere the breaking of the world.

Some advocate for the city to be spared, its location and infrastructure a lynchpin of the new administration. Others content the city should be sacked, too dangerous and corrupted to leave intact.
